    Recettes & récits de François-Régis Gaudry 155 recipes to share
  summary: >-
    <p>François-Régis Gaudry's book Recipe & récits (published in 2024) is a very personal collection of 155 recipes that combine daily cuisine, travel dishes and family memories. Each recipe is accompanied by an anecdote or a "story" that tells the origin - a family transmission, a discovery abroad, or a loan from a chef. The aim is to make the cuisine accessible, varied (Corsian, Italian, Balkan, Asian, etc.) and "intractable".</p><p><br>The studio was invited by Audrey Genin of Marabout editions to imagine the graphic design of a sober and elegant book as well as a cover illustrated by Anna Wanda Gogusey.</p>
