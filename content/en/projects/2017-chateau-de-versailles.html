    <p>The Palace of Versailles is an absolute masterpiece of French monarchical art. Built by Louis XIV to embody the power and refinement of his reign, it displays majestic architecture, geometric gardens as far as the eye can see and sumptuous salons where gilding and mirrors shine. More than a palace, Versailles was the theater of absolute power, a dazzling symbol of grandeur and political staging, whose harmony and excess continue to amaze today.<br><br>The studio was invited by the Spintank agency to carry out the artistic direction of the website during the call for tenders in 2017. Following the selection of the proposal, Takumi supports the agency in monitoring production. For this occasion, he created a series of illustrations of the emblematic places of the estate.</p>
