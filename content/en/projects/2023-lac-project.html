    LAC Project Visual Artists Collective
  summary: >-
    <p>LAC Project is a multidisciplinary artistic collective founded by choreographer and musician Mathieu Calmelet and visual artist Ludivine Large-Bessette, then joined by sound artist Octave Courtin.<br><br>Both artistic collaboration and production structure, LAC Project explores the social uses of the body through a very open practice where contemporary dance, performance, digital art, music and video appear in an assumed porosity. This deliberately hybrid work allows the collective to better let their questions shine through by associating different mediums with dance, to address each project: augmented reality to question the societal fantasy of an all-powerful body, video to identify the importance of the gaze and power relations in classic traditions of representation of the body, acoustic and electronic music to explore new relational modes between the human body and the machine.<br><br>Creation of the visual identity of the collective as well as their creation file.</p>
