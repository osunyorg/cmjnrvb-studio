    Elle The women's weekly
  summary: >-
    <p>The magazine ELLE, founded in France in November 1945, has become an essential reference in the world's women's press. Since its creation by Hélène Gordon-Lazareff, its motto was not to choose between frivolity or seriousness, but to be able to combine "serious in frivolity, irony in the grave". She addresses women today, accompanying them in all aspects of their lives — fashion, beauty, culture, society — with a demanding and accessible look. Present in more than forty countries, it embodies a global brand of "female" that goes well beyond mere fashion magazine to become a space of inspiration, information and emancipation.</p><p>The digital team uses the studio to accompany them on this major overhaul. Several projects have been carried out in parallel: the identity aspects have been harmonized to be closer to the brand and creative direction of the magazine led by Tom Meredith, the strategic vision and UX workshops have been animated in order to create synergy with the different professions (presidency, brand, product, governance and membership...) and to understand the stakes for the readers.</p><p>The studio creates a new artistic and interactive direction and lays the foundations of the integrated design system by CMI teams.</p><p>Team<br>Julien Mehl: Strategic direction and project<br>Yuna Orsini: direction UX<br>Takumi Kobayashi: creative and artistic direction</p>
