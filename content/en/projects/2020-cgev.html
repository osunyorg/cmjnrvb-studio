    <p>The CGEV is a French studio for digital visual effects (VFX) founded in 2012 in Paris by former collaborators of the Duran Duboi studio. Located in the 10th arrondissement of Paris, it works on film, television and streaming productions, offering a wide range of services: 2D compositing, 3D modelling, fluids, particles, digital painting (matte painting), filming supervision, etc. The studio is distinguished by its artistic requirement, its ability to manage both modest projects (generic endings) and complex visual effects for large films or international series. Since its creation, CGEV has already participated in the production of hundreds of films, and has collaborated with international platforms such as Netflix, Disney+ or Amazon Prime Video.</p><p>She uses the studio cmjnrvb to rethink the UX and design of her website.</p><p>Development by Antoine Martin</p>
