    CIDS The global center of competence for international dispute resolution
  summary: >-
    <p>The Centre for International Dispute Settlement (CIDS) in Geneva is a leading academic institution in the field of international dispute resolution. It is the result of collaboration between the University of Geneva and the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies, thus benefiting from a particularly rich and international intellectual environment. Located in the heart of Geneva, the ICDS focuses on studying and understanding the mechanisms by which conflicts between States, companies or investors are resolved, whether through arbitration, mediation or other forms of dispute settlement. Beyond research, the centre plays an essential role in the training of specialists in international dispute law, notably through the master's program LL.M. Geneva LL.M. in International Dispute Settlement (MIDS), recognized for its academic excellence. CIDS also contributes to the international debate through events, summer schools and intensive courses for students, professionals and researchers. Due to Geneva's position as one of the world's leading centres for arbitration and international mediation, the ICDS plays a strategic role. It trains tomorrow's practitioners, supports research and promotes reflection on developments in international law, thereby strengthening the city's reputation as the world capital for dispute resolution.</p><p>With Noesya, the studio collaborates with the CIDS teams to rethink, clarify the identity aspects (logotypes, typographical, chromatic...), the user experience and interface design of their two CIDS and MIDS portals. A superb team listening: Quentin Pinczon du Sel (UX), Arnaud Levy (CTO), Olivia Simonet (Development), Callie Cunningham and Cyprien Fluzin from CIDS.</p>
