    <p>Since 2014, the website of France Inter has become obsolete and no longer meets the objective of accessibility and navigation. From 2015, The Radio France group is beginning the renewal of the stations' sites. France Inter is the main public service station with 5,443 000 daily listeners. In autumn 2015, Digital Management launches a call for tender to carry out the redesign and accompany Radio France teams on user experience and interface design. It was in 2016 that Samuel Rousselier in charge of UX and myself for the design part interface and information architecture aircraft began reflection the new site.</p>
